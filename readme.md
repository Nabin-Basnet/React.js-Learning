## 📖 JavaScript Basics

To understand React better, you should have a good grasp of modern JavaScript, including:

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Functions (Arrow functions, Callbacks)
- ES6 features (Destructuring, Spread operator, Modules)
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Classes and Objects

## 🧠 Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

| Feature | Real DOM | Virtual DOM |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Update Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Manipulation | Directly changes UI | Uses a virtual copy |
| Performance | Less efficient | More efficient |

React uses the **Virtual DOM** to boost performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.

## ❓ Why React?

- 🔁 Component-Based Architecture
- ⚡ Fast rendering with Virtual DOM
- 💡 Learn Once, Use Anywhere
- 🧩 Rich ecosystem (Hooks, Redux, Router)
- 🔥 Huge community and job opportunities

---

## 🏗️ Library vs Framework

- **Library (React)**: Gives you tools to build UI — *you control the flow*.
- **Framework (Angular, Vue)**: Comes with structure — *it controls the flow*.

React is flexible and can be integrated into any project without enforcing structure.
